# Background settings
# You can use an image, a color, or even a video.
# To match your dark theme, consider a subtle dark image or a dark color.
# A video background can be resource-intensive and might not be smooth.

# Example with an image:
 background = /usr/share/backgrounds/wallhaven1.png

# Example with a solid color, matching your Qtile background:
background-color = #1E1E2E
# If you use a background image, you might adjust its brightness
# background-brightness = 0.7 # (0.0-1.0, 1.0 is full brightness)

# Theme settings - Crucial for matching your Qtile look
# You'll need GTK themes and icon themes installed on your system.
# Common dark GTK themes: Adwaita-dark, Arc-Dark, Dracula, Catppuccin-Frappe-Dark
# Common icon themes: Papirus, breeze, Adwaita
theme-name = Catppuccin-Mocha-Standard-Dark # Choose a GTK theme you like that is dark
icon-theme-name = Papirus # Choose an icon theme that complements your setup
font-name = JetBrainsMono Nerd Font 10 # Match your Qtile font and size

# Welcome message
welcome-text = Welcome to Arch Linux! # Or any custom message

# Clock format
# clock-format = %H:%M:%S  # 24-hour format
clock-format = %I:%M %p   # 12-hour format with AM/PM

# Panel position (top, bottom, left, right)
panel-position = bottom # Matches your Qtile bar position

# Visibility of various elements on the panel
show-power = true       # Show power buttons (shutdown, restart)
show-clock = true
show-hostname = false   # Often not needed on a personal machine
show-user-image = true  # Display user avatars
show-user-list = true   # Show the list of users to log in
show-a11y = false       # Accessibility options
show-keyboard = false   # On-screen keyboard icon

# Custom Logo (optional)
# If you have a custom logo or brand image you want to display
# logo = /path/to/your/custom_logo.png
# logo-x-offset = 0
# logo-y-offset = 0

# User image settings (if show-user-image is true)
# If a user doesn't have a custom avatar, this default will be used
# default-user-image = /usr/share/pixmaps/faces/default-user.png # Replace with a path you like

# Session & Language
# last-session = true
# last-language = true
